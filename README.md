# Data-Structures-Project-2-Fibonacci
The second programming assignment for the Data Structures class at Florida Polytechnic University

# Overview
**From the Fibonacci.pdf file provided:**
"In this programming assignment, you will implement a Fibonacci function that avoids repetitive computation by computing the sequence linearly from the bottom up: F(0) through F(n). You will also overcome the limitations of Câ€™s 32-bit integers by storing very large integers in arrays of individual digits.

By completing this assignment, you will gain experience crafting algorithms of moderate complexity, develop a deeper understanding of integer type limitations, become acquainted with unsigned integers, and reinforce your understanding of dynamic memory management in C. In the end, you will have a very fast and awesome program for computing huge Fibonacci numbers."
